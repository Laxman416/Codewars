## Introduction

This Repository contains all the projects completed such as SQL for Data Cleaning and Data Analysis.
Contains all the assessments completed on Codewars for multiple programming languages.
These assessments test my attention to detail, testing for syntax and logic errors, problem solving and technical skills related to programming.

  - [SQL CodeWars Challenges](CodeWarsREADME.md#sql-challenges)
  
    *Description: The SQL CodeWars Challenges focus specifically on database-related tasks, encouraging users to write efficient and effective SQL queries.*

  ### 📗 SQL Projects

  - 💳 **Project 1 - Credit Card Fraud SQL Analysis**
  
    - [Project README](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)
  
    - [CSV file of Credit Card Info](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)
    
    - [Project notebook](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)

    - [Project Report](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)

    *Description: This dataset consists of credit card transactions in the western United States. It includes information about each transaction including customer details, the merchant and category of purchase, and whether or not the transaction was a fraud. An overview of the project is shown in the markdown file, and the analysis is conducted on a jupterlab notebook. A small report is written about the result, talking about each question answered in SQL and the results.*
