## Introduction

This Repository contains all the projects completed such as SQL for Data Cleaning and Data Analysis.
Contains all the assessments completed on Codewars for multiple programming languages.
These assessments test my attention to detail, testing for syntax and logic errors, problem solving and technical skills related to programming.


## Python

  A collection of notes and challenges for Python programming. This section includes various notes on syntax, libraries, and best practices. 

  ### 📓 Python Notes

  ### ⚔️ Python CodeWars Challenges 

  - [Python CodeWars Challenges](CodeWarsREADME.md#python-challenges)

    *Description: The Python CodeWars Challenges are specifically tailored to enhance your proficiency in Python, focusing on key concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

  ### 📗 Python Projects

  - **Project 1: Measuring Production Asymmetry of Neutral Charm Mesons From LHCb Run2.**
  
    - [Github Repository](https://github.com/sjtaylor-9/LHCb-D0-asymmetry)
    - [Semester 1 MPhys Report](Python/Report/Masters_S1.pdf)

      *Description: MPhys Project Semester 1 supervised by Eva Gersabeck and Aodhan Burke and completed with Sam Taylor. 
                    Optimised the model from the previous students.*

      * Key Libraries Used: matplotlib, argparse, pandas, ROOT, NumPy, SciPy

  - **Project 2: Extended Study on Measuring Production Asymmetry of Neutral Charm Mesons From LHCb Run2.**
  
    - [Github Repository](https://github.com/sjtaylor-9/LHCb-D0-asymmetry-2)
    - [Semester 2 MPhys Report](Python/Report/Masters_S2.pdf)


      *Description: MPhys Project Semester 2 supervised by Eva Gersabeck and Aodhan Burke and completed with Sam Taylor.
                    This project focused on increasing the dataset, creating a new model for the larger dataset, modelling the detection asymmetry and creating a simulation to compare the actual results with simulated results.*

      * Key Libraries Used: matplotlib, argparse, pandas, ROOT, NumPy, SciPy
  
## SQL

  A collection of notes and challenges for SQL programming. This section includes various notes on syntax, table relationships, and databases.

  ### 📓 SQL Notes 
  - [SQL's Basic Notes](SQL/Notes/SQL_notes.md) *Description: Covers the basics of SQL like SELECT, ...*
  - [SQL PDF Notes](<SQL/Notes/SQL Notes PDF.pdf>) *Description: Downloaded from s-shemmee github.*


  ### ⚔️ SQL CodeWars Challenges
  
  - [SQL CodeWars Challenges](CodeWarsREADME.md#sql-challenges)
  
    *Description: The SQL CodeWars Challenges focus specifically on database-related tasks, encouraging users to write efficient and effective SQL queries.*

  ### 📗 SQL Projects

  - 💳 **Project 1 - Credit Card Fraud SQL Analysis**
  
    - [Project README](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)
  
    - [CSV file of Credit Card Info](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)
    
    - [Project notebook](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)

    - [Project Report](SQL/6kyu/Projects/CreditCardFraud/)

    *Description: This dataset consists of credit card transactions in the western United States. It includes information about each transaction including customer details, the merchant and category of purchase, and whether or not the transaction was a fraud. An overview of the project is shown in the markdown file, and the analysis is conducted on a jupterlab notebook. A small report is written about the result, talking about each question answered in SQL and the results.*

## C++
