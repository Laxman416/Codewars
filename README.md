# CodingRepository
This Repository contains all the projects completed such as SQL for Data Cleaning and Data Analysis.
Contains all the assessments completed on Codewars for multiple programming languages.
These assessments test my attention to detail, testing for syntax and logic errors, problem solving and technical skills related to programming.

**Languages:**
- Python
- C++
- SQL
- R

Each Language is split into kyu ranging from 8kyu to 1kyu.
8kyu challenges are the easiest while 1kyu are the hardest.
